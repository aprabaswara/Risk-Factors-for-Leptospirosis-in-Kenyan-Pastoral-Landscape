# Risk-Factors-for-Leptospirosis-in-Kenyan-Pastoral-Landscape
The goal of this project is to identify individual risk factors for leptospirosis infection in a rural area of Kenya. This research could help to inform health intervention programmes aimed at reducing leptospirosis infections in pastoral areas. The International Livestock Research Institute collected samples from members of households in villages in Tana River County, Kenya, and tested them for leptospirosis using ELISA. Demographic data, occupational data, animal contact behaviour, and environmental data were also collected from sampled individuals. The analysis results of this project is written in the form of a report to aid Bernard Bett and the International Livestock Research Institute.
